# CS 076/276 : Artificial Intelligence

The code in this repository was developed as part of coursework for Dartmouth's Artificial Intelligence class, CC - 76. Do not read the contents in this repository if you're currently taking the class, as my code will possibly only confuse you and deter you from doing your best work and understanding the course material. Not to mention, code plagiarism is checked and strictly penalized by the school.

***Coming Soon: Reimplementation of the Python problems and Algorithms in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), a purely functional programming language.***
