# PA1: Mazeworld

This directory contains code for robot navigation in a Maze

> To test Mazeworld, which navigates a robot (or a number of robots) from a start location to a goal location / sequence of goal locations, run [test_mazeworld.py](test_mazeworld.py).
> To test Sensorless navigation, which starts with a number of possible start locations for a robot and finds the shortest number oof actions after which the robot's location can be determined, run [test_sensorless.py](test_sensorless.py)

Note: You might want to view the files to comment out or uncomment some tests, since running all of them at a go takes a lot of time.
