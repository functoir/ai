# PA3: Chess AI

This directory contains code for Chess-playing AI.

> To test, select your desired game in [test_chess.py](./test_chess.py) and either run the file, or, if on a Linux machine, run `make test` in the terminal.

Note: You might want to view the files to comment out or uncomment some tests, since running all of them at a go takes a lot of time.
